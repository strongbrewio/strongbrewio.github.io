title: Cancellable optimistic updates in Angular 2 and Redux
published: true
description: Angular 4 and redux] are 2 technologies that are getting a lot of traction these days. Angular 2 is a SPA (single-page-app) framework and redux is a state management tool. Most developers that are using Angular 2 are using the @ngrx/store variant of the redux principle. Because I'm one of them I will be using @ngrx/store instead of redux.js for this article. Don't let that bother you, what you are about to read can be used with redux.js in the exact same way.
