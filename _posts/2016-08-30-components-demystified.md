description: These documents are the beginning of a book (or a collection of documents) that will explain SPA-principles in depth. SPA's (single-page-apps) offer us the opportunity to create responsive userfriendly webapplications that have a native look-and-feel. However, with great power comes great responsability! It's not always easy to manage those SPA's when they tend to get big, and most of the time... they will! When applying the principles of 'spa concepts demystified' you should be able to create large-scale applications like it's 'a walk in the park'.
